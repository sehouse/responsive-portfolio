Commit 1:
I created the files associated with the Week 2 homework.

Commit 2: 
I created an Assets folder and copied the example images from gitlab into it. I also created a CSS file in the Assets folder. I took each html file and added the initial formatting of an html document and also linked Bootstrap CSS and my CSS file in each head tag.

Commit 3:
I added the Bootstrap NavBar to each of my pages, changing the title of the bar to my name, and changing each link to the names of the individual pages. I made sure to change the "active" class to match the page that the code is actually in, so that the links in the NavBar display the proper page as highlighted. I also linked the Bootstrap JS, so that the NavBar will properly work when it is in a smaller screen format. The "page link" buttons on the NavBar are also now aligned to the left of the screen.
