Commit 1:
I created the files associated with the Week 2 homework.

Commit 2: 
I created an Assets folder and copied the example images from gitlab into it. I also created a CSS file in the Assets folder. I took each html file and added the initial formatting of an html document and also linked Bootstrap CSS and my CSS file in each head tag.

Commit 3:
I added the Bootstrap NavBar to each of my pages, changing the title of the bar to my name, and changing each link to the names of the individual pages. I made sure to change the "active" class to match the page that the code is actually in, so that the links in the NavBar display the proper page as highlighted. I also linked the Bootstrap JS, so that the NavBar will properly work when it is in a smaller screen format. The "page link" buttons on the NavBar are also now aligned to the left of the screen.

Commit 4:
I linked the proper HTML pages to the NavBar buttons, so that they will direct to the correct pages when clicked. I also used the CSS to change the background color to a placeholder color, so that it is earier to see the body changes that I make. A footer was also added to each HTML page.

Commit 5:
I created the container for the "About Me" section of my index page, using a card and h1 for the title, and then added an image and placement text. I also made the image responsive to screen size changes.

Commit 6:
I altered some CSS to try to fix the lack of background color to my container.

Commit 7:
I created the form for my "Contact" page.

Commit 8:
I created the rows and columns of placeholder pictures for my "Portfolio" page. I also adjusted the container width for all pages in my CSS file. The basic framework for this homework is now in place, and I can focus on changing the visual styles of each page to something more enjoyable to me.

Commit 9:
I adjusted the colors of the navbar and footer to be a dark blue, while the background and navbar/footer text are cornflower blue. The containers on each page are now royal blue. I changed the hr tag in each container to now be a double line.
